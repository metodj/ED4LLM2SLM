I want you to act as an Instruction Creator.
Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Instruction# to create a brand new instruction.
This new instruction should belong to the same domain as the #Given Instruction# but be even more rare.
The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Instruction# should be similar to that of the #Given Instruction#.
The #Created Instruction# must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans.
'#Given Instruction#', '#Created Instruction#', 'given instruction' and 'created instruction' are not allowed to appear in #Created Instruction#.

#Given Instruction#:
